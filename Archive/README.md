# BlueHarrier's school archive

Welcome to the archive! Here you can find (almost) all of my work from all of my degrees. Some of them can be found in folders, others in MD files with links to Google Drive. Keep in mind that most comments and titles will be in Spanish as that's my native tongue and the one I did most of my studies in.

## Primary school teaching (work in progress)

## [Multiplatform application development](./mad/)

## Animation, games and interactive environments (work in progress)
